This single page portfolio is a project requirement for the completion of a six month job-ready web development program offered on Coursera by the University of Michigan USA.

It was quite a challenging task because prior to working on this project, I have only worked on recreating or cloning an already existing webpage.

Trying to sketch responsive layouts with the use of Figma for the first time can be more challenging than developing the codes to turn them into an interactive webpage.

At the end of the project, I came to an understanding that one can still do well, not exceptionally but quite remarkably in areas they do not flow easily and naturally.
